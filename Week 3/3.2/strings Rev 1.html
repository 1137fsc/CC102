  HTML page "strings". 
 Here I will create a user input visual and an output visual.
 If time provides, I would like to animate the text, give an explaination 
 of what a palindrome is, and imbed a youtube video that just came out on palindromes -->

 <!-- in the body, I want my header, subheader with some explaination of what is to come

     used this https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_form_input_types.asp to find out how to create the input type text, this also has some for the input type, which I think is a self filter. I am reading more into this-->

Keeping them the same is fine for this, but noteworthy later -->
        <!-- <input type="submit" value="Submit"> I commented this out because it is more for form submission and I need to use a button click as an event. seems this will reset the page and do things that I will have to stop or move away from default behavior.
